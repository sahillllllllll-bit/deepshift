You are a Principal Full-Stack Architect and Senior MERN Engineer.

A half-completed, real-world MERN application named DeepShift already exists.
Your task is to complete the remaining work, fix all issues, and fully connect the backend and frontend, delivering a production-ready SaaS platform.

This is NOT a demo project.
This must behave like a commercial, scalable, secure contest platform.

1. CURRENT STATE (IMPORTANT)

Frontend and backend codebases already exist

Basic project structure, routing, and some models/APIs are implemented

Some authentication, UI pages, and dashboards are partially done

Several flows are incomplete, buggy, disconnected, or insecure

Some UI components exist but are not fully wired to backend APIs

Some backend logic exists but is not fully enforced or optimized

👉 You must NOT rewrite everything from scratch
👉 You must complete, fix, harden, and integrate what already exists

2. CORE OBJECTIVE

Finish DeepShift as a fully functional, production-ready MERN SaaS platform that:

Runs locally and in production using:

npm install
npm run dev
npm start


Uses NO Docker

Supports 2,000+ concurrent users

Implements real logic only (no mocks, no placeholders)

Has secure authentication, role separation, payments, contests, results, and referrals

React.js (Hooks)

Context API or Redux Toolkit
