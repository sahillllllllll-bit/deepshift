You are a principal full-stack architect and senior MERN engineer.

Build a production-ready, real-world online contest platform named DeepShift using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

⚠️ DO NOT use Docker
⚠️ DO NOT include Dockerfiles or docker-compose
⚠️ The project must run locally and in production using standard Node workflows (npm install, npm run dev, npm start).

The system must be fully functional, secure, and capable of handling 2,000+ concurrent users, behaving like a commercial SaaS product, not a demo.
